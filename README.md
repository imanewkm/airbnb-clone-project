## Overview
This project is a simplified clone of the Airbnb platform, designed to replicate core functionalities such as property listings, user authentication, and booking management.

## Project Goals
- Recreate key features of Airbnb's user interface and functionality.
- Implement a responsive and user-friendly front-end design.
- Integrate back-end services for data management and user authentication.
- Gain experience with modern web development tools and frameworks.

## Front-End Tech Stack

- **Redux (or Context API)**: For state management across the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Axios**: For handling API requests.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds.
